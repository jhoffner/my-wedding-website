For those traveling from out-of-state, it is recommended that you arrive on Thursday night so that you will be able to settle in, relax, and be ready to take part in the activities the next day. </p> <p> Many of us traveling from Los Angeles will be arriving Thursday evening at the venue to settle in and start pre-partying for the weekend. For travelers coming in early on Thursday, you are welcome to join us at the estate after you check-in to your hotels. Parking is limited so you should coordinate with us when you plan to arrive into Ojai so that we can help arrange transportation for you to the venue. </p> </section> <section> <h2>Friday, Oct 9th</h2> <img src=images/pool.svg> <h3>Pool Party <span>@ 11 AM</span></h3> <p> It’s fall, but it will still be warm enough in beautiful Ojai to take part in a bunch of outdoor fun. We will be relaxing by the pool and partaking in some lawn games. We will be barbecuing for lunch so there will be food and drinks. </p> <p> You should bring your swimsuit and sneakers if you want to play Basketball. We should have enough pool towels for everyone. </p> <img src=images/henna.svg> <h3>Henna Party <span>@ 6:30 PM</span></h3> <p> Jennifer’s family will be providing a Bengali style celebration not to be missed. You can expect dinner, entertainment, Henna tattoos and more. </p> <p> If you have proper Indian attire then please bring it with you. The family will also be providing Sarees and mens attire to guests so that everyone can take part in the celebration. </p> </section> <section> <h2>Saturday, Oct 10th</h2> <img src=images/hanging.svg> <h3>Hanging Out <span>@ 11 AM</span></h3> <p> More time to relax! We will be hanging out at the estate during the morning/afternoon. We will have some wedding preperation activities for those who wish to partake. Everyone else can just relax and swap stories from the previous night’s awesomeness. </p> <img src=images/ceremony.svg> <h3>Seal The Deal <span>@ 6:00 PM</span></h3> <p>The ceremony will be held on the lower lawn of the estate. It is a short walk down and back.</p> <p>For those who decide to hang back at their hotel until the ceremony starts: We will be providing a shuttle service from The Capri Hotel and Ojai Presbyterian Church from 4:30PM - 5:30 PM.</p> <img src=images/drinks.svg> <h3>Pre-Gaming <span>@ 6:45 PM</span></h3> <p>Cocktail and refreshments at the estate.</p> <img src=images/reception.svg> <h3>Reception <span>@ 7:45 PM</span></h3> <p>The vows have been said, and the crowd has been properly liquored up. It's now time to rock out. Dinner will be served on the pool patio, followed by indoor dancing and general drunkenness.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Sunday, Oct 11th</h2> <img src=images/breakfast.svg> <h3>Breakfast <span>@ 9 AM</span></h3> <p>Check-out time from the estate is at 12 PM. We will be providing a continental breakfast at the property before then to help everyone move past their hangovers. </p> </section> <section class="featured travel-header" id=travel> <img src=images/travel_badge.svg> <h2>Travel Information</h2> </section> <div class=travel-map> <div class="bullet a"><span>A</span></div> <div class="bullet b"><span>B</span></div> <div class="bullet c"><span>C</span></div> </div> <section class=featured> <img src=images/sleep.svg> <h3>Sleep</h3> </section> <section class=travel> <div class=bullet><span>A</span></div> <h3><a href=http://www.hotelojai.com>The Capri Hotel</a></h3> <p>15 rooms have been blocked out at a rate of $159.99 a night. Just mention the Hoffner wedding. On the day of the reception, we will be organizing shuttles to and from the venue.</p> <div class=bullet><span>B</span></div> <h3><a href="http://www.blueiguanainn.com/">Blue Iguana Inn & Suites</a></h3> <p>Rooms have not been blocked out but should be available. It is located a little further away than the other options. There will not be a shuttle service from this location.</p> <div class=bullet><span>C</span></div> <h3><a href="http://www.ojairesort.com/">Ojai Valley Inn & Spa</a></h3> <p>Rooms have not been blocked out but should be available. Ojai Valley Inn is considerably more expensive but is an amazing place to lay your head. We stayed here for our anniversery one year and loved it.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <h3><a href=http://www.airbnb.com>AirBnb</a></h3> <p>For those of you traveling in groups, you may find the best deal on AirBnb. We vagabonded for 6 months using AirBnb a few years ago and can attest to how well it works.</p> </section> <section class=featured> <img src=images/air.svg> <h3>Air</h3> </section> <section> <h2>Santa Barbara (SBA)</h2> <p>If you can swing it SBA will be the best airport to fly into. It is about 50 minutes away from Ojai. For those flying in on Thursday night, we may be able to arrange someone to pick you up from the airport. Please reach out to us and we will see if we can accomodate you.</p> <h2>Los Angeles (LAX)</h2> <p>LAX is about 90 minutes away from Ojai without traffic. Its LA, there is usually traffic, so unless you are flying in late at night you will probably want to budget about 2 hours of driving time. </p> <p>LAX will be your cheapest option. For family flying from Baltimore, Jennifer’s father will be able to organize a group discount that as of now is $377 round-trip for 5 or more people. Spirit airlines may also be an ever more cost efficient option. If you consider flying Spirit please take note of why its costs are lower and make sure you will not incure additional costs (such as carry on baggage).</p> <p>Group travel into LAX is highly recommended as you will be able to save money by carpooling. </p> </section> <section class=featured> <img src=images/car.svg> <h3>Road</h3> </section> <section> <h2>Parking</h2> <h4>Estate Parking</h4> <p>The estate has limited parking and will likely be mostly taken by the guests who will be sleeping at the estate. For this reason we will need to carpool whenever possible when traveling to and from hotels. </p> <p><b>There will be no parking allowed on the street outside of the estate. We will be ticketed if you do so.</b> However there should be parking available down the street from the estate and would only require a short walk.</p> <h4>Church Parking</h4> <p>Overnight parking is made available @ the Ojai Presbyterian Church located at 304 N. Foothill Rd. The church is close to the estate, but not within a comfortable walking distance.</p> <p>The church will be the primary pickup spot for shuttle service on Saturday.</p> <h2>Shuttles</h2> <p>A limited shuttle service will be available to guests on the day of the wedding. We have the shuttle for 3 hours and will have specific windows in which it will take guests to and from the venue.</p> <h4>Shuttle Pickup Time & Location</h4> <p> The shuttle will begin pickup at <b>4:30 at the Capri Hotel</b>. For guests staying at the hotel we recommend you begin waiting outside 10 minutes early. It will then proceed to the Ojai Presbyterian Church for pickup. We only have the shuttle for an hour (from 4:30 to 5:30) for pickup so please be at your pickup location on time. </p> <h4>Shuttle Return</h4> <p>The shuttle service will begin its return service at 10 PM and run for 2 hours. It will drop you off at either the church or the Capri Hotel.</p> <h2>Uber</h2> <p>Uber X is available in Ojai and will be a great way to get around without having to worry about parking, shuttle times or drunk driving. The hotels are very close to the property so with enough coordination from other guests (ride sharing) the costs should be minimal.</p> </section> <section class=gifts id=gifts> <img src=images/gifts.svg> <p>We don't need you to bring us gifts – we know plane tickets are expensive and your presence at the wedding is enough! If you really want to give us something, a contribution to our honeymoon fund would be greatly appreciated.</p> <h2>Ways to send money</h2> <div class=option> <div class=bullet><span>1</span></div> Old School (Check/Cash) <p> Please email or Facebook us if you need our address. </p> </div> <div class=option> <div class=bullet><span>2</span></div> New School (Online) <p> <a href=https://plasso.co/jake.hoffner@gmail.com>Credit/Debit Card</a>, <a href=http://www.venmo.com>Venmo</a>, <a href=https://cash.me/$jhoffner>Square Cash</a> or <a href=https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/send-money-online>Paypal</a> to Jake's phone number or email (jake.hoffner@gmail.com). </p> </div> </section> <section id=rsvp> <img src=images/rsvp.svg> <form> <h3>Please RSVP by August 1st</h3> <div class=form-group> <label class=required>Your Name</label> <input type=text name=name placeholder="Please provide your full name"> </div> <div class=form-group> <label>Will you be attending?</label> <select name=attending> <option></option> <option value=yes>Yes</option> <option value=no>No</option> </select> </div> <div class=attending> <div class=form-group> <label>Your email address</label> <input type=email name=email> </div> <div class=form-group> <label>You're dinner preference?</label> <select name=dinner> <option></option> <option value="No Preference">No Preference</option> <option value="No Shellfish">No Shellfish</option> <option value="No Beef">No Beef</option> <option value=Vegeterian>Vegeterian</option> </select> </div> <div class=form-group id=guest> <label>Will you be bringing a guest?</label> <select name=guest> <option></option> <option value=yes>Yes</option> <option value=no>No</option> </select> </div> <div class="form-group guest"> <label>What is your guest's name?</label> <input type=text name=guest_name> </div> <div class="form-group guest"> <label>You're guest's dinner preference?</label> <select name=guest_dinner> <option></option> <option value="No Preference">No Preference</option> <option value="No Shellfish">No Shellfish</option> <option value="No Beef">No Beef</option> <option value=Vegeterian>Vegeterian</option> </select> </div> <div class=form-group id=guest> <label>When can we expect you to arrive?</label> <select name=arrival> <option></option> <option value=thurs>Thursday</option> <option value=fri_morning>Friday Morning</option> <option value=fri_evening>Friday Evening</option> <option value=sat>Saturday</option> </select> </div> <div class=form-group> <label>Please provide a song to add to our playlist</label> <input type=text name=song placeholder="Artist / Song"> </div> </div> <div class=form-group> <label>Any additional notes?</label> <textarea name=notes></textarea> </div> <input type=submit> </form> <div class=success style=display:none;> <img src=images/confetti.svg> <h3>RSVP Sent!</h3> </div> </section> <section class=featured> <img src=images/H.svg> </section> <script type=text/javascript src=http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js></script> <script type=text/javascript src=http://www.parsecdn.com/js/parse-1.4.2.min.js></script>  <script>
